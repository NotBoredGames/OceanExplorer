Pixel line going trough the line.
	Happens on 360 degree lights.
	Only on 2x and 3x light shaders.
	Only when using textures, vertex colors work fine.
	Caused by antialiasing.
	
Fixes
	Disable antialiasing in Qulity setting.
	Disable texture, only use vertex colors.
	Reduce light down from 360 degrees.
	Change to another shader.
